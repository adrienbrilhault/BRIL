Description: The BRIL algorithm estimates the main mode of bivariate distributions 
  through three principal steps: 
  - BOOTSTRAP: a recursive depth (or convex body minimizers) trimming to locate a 
  first estimate.
  - REFINE: a two-pass outliers filtering, the first relying on euclidean distances 
  to the first estimate and unimodality tests, the second on robust distances and 
  multinormality tests.
  - ITERATE: after removing the samples selected in the REFINE step from the global 
  distribution, the same process is reapplied, the first mode corresponding to the 
  iteration with the largest number of samples.
