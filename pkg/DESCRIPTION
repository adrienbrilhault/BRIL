Description: The BRIL algorithm estimate the main mode of bivariate distribuitions through three principal steps: 
    BOOTSTRAP: a recursive depth triming (or recusive convex body minimizers) to locate a first estimate.
    REFINE: a two-pass outliers filtering, the first relying on euclidian distance to the first estimate and unimodality tests, the second on robust distances and multinormality tests.
    ITERATE: removing the samples selected in the REFINE step from the global distribution, the same process is reapplied, the final mode corresponding to the iteration with the largest number of samples.
